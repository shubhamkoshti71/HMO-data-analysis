Analysis of the dataset to see which predictors influence whether a person will be an "expensive" entity or not. Various factors might influence this decision and we will look at a few visuals, work on the data using predictive analysis to reach a conclusion for the management.

> Project tasks

1. Data cleaning
2. Analyze all variables, use summary() and other functions to explore data
3. Make scatterplots and bar graphs, histograms
4. Identify significant predictors for the cost column
5. Add column 'expensive' and split data into training and test sets
6. Use 2-3 models and see which one is the best
7. Run stats on expensive column to see which variables affect these values
8. Build plots and graphs to visualize 'expensive' and explain why some people spend more than others (based on sevaral factors), and show maps
